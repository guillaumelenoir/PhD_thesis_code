# PhD_thesis_code
Code relative to the three main chapters of the thesis. 

The thesis is available at https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:191751

The code of Chap. 2 and 3 requires the software WAVEPAL to be installed (https://github.com/guillaumelenoir/WAVEPAL)
An old version of the software is required: Take the commit 61c3251 from 10 May 2017. 
But... you may have trouble installing the package since it will link to the RECENT versions of the external packages and librairies. If this happens, I recommend you to use the LATEST version (i.e. not from the commit 61c3251) of the files "MacOSX_install.sh" and "Linux_install.sh".
